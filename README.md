# Tiny Improvements

My goal for this mod is to add some tiny improvements to Minecraft. I am basing a lot of these ideas off of a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSsac8V3BpA) by
[SimplySarc](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4Ppudb5EGHNpIYQPVpKdw). Thank you so much for the ideas! :)
