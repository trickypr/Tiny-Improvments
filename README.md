# Tiny Improvements

My goal for this mod is to add some tiny improvements to Minecraft. I am basing a lot of these ideas off of a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSsac8V3BpA) by
[SimplySarc](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4Ppudb5EGHNpIYQPVpKdw). Thank you so much for the ideas! :)

## Improvements still to do
Improvments are avalilabe in the [projects](https://github.com/trickypr/Tiny-Improvments/projects/1).

If you have any ideas or any mods that do the same jobs as some of these thing, please open an issue.

## People I should probably thank
-  [jonqrandom](https://github.com/jonqrandom): Providing information about some of the features that should be included. [issue](https://github.com/trickypr/Tiny-Improvments/issues/2)
